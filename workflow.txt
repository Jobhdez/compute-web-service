* user #1: startup hiring manager
as a user I want to integrate a Scheme interpreter engine into my app. Why? I run a startup and I need to test how well the candidates for a given job know Scheme. So, the Scheme engine
will help me interview candidate. As a user I want to be able to make challenges and have the candiate answer the challenges.

* # user #2
As a user I want to learn Scheme so I want to search for challenges that were created by other users. And as a user who wants to learn Scheme, I would like to invite my friends to take the challenge
with me.
